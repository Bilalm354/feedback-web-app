# Developer Problem

## Problem:

A client wishes to build a web application that can be used for feedback.
Users should be able to anonymously submit feedback via a form, and should receive confirmation on successful submission.
The collection of submitted feedback should be viewable as a whole.

## Stretch goal:

Change the ability to view the collection of submitted feedback so that it is restricted to authorised users.
You can use any language / framework you wish to write your solution. Obviously the solution should compile and run.
Once complete, either zip the solution and send it back to your recruiter or share your repository link.
